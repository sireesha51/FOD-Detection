# FOD Detection in Airport Runways using CNN

This repository presents a deep learning-based solution to detect **Foreign Object Debris (FOD)** on airport runways using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and the **FOD-A dataset**.

## Overview
Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on airport runways can lead to severe damages and costly accidents. This project uses CNNs to detect and classify such debris.

## Methodology
- CNN based on EfficientNet
- Dataset: FOD-A (Plastic, Metal, Concrete)
- mAP (CNN): 0.67 vs YOLO: 0.33

## Structure
See the `src/`, `notebooks/`, and `data/` folders for implementation and sample data structure.
